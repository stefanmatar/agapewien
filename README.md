## Development Environment

The best development experience for Vue Development is either using the Webstorm IDE from IntelliJ or Visual Studio Code from Microsoft.

If you use Chrome, [Vue Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd) exists, making your life easier when debugging.

### Webstorm

Webstorm has most of the code linting as well as automatic code analysis built in. Nothing special needs to be installed when using Webstorm to develop in Vue.

This tool costs, but the community edition should be fine if you don't have a licence.

### Visual Studio Code

VSC is known to be something in-between a normal notepad and an IDE. To use it as a reliable development environment, add these plugins:

* [Vue Extention pack containing most used plugins](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mubaidr.vuejs-extension-pack)
* [Vetur](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur)
* [Vue peek](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dariofuzinato.vue-peek)

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification, uses webpack
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```

What these commands do precicely can be seen in the package.json file in the root directory of the project.

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [webpack guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
